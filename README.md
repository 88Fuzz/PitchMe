# PitchMe
Global Game Jam 2018

Use your voice to control the movement. First calibrate your voice by huming a tone and clicking Calibrate Pitch. Hold until the green square fills. This is now your median frequency. Sing higher to move up and sing lower to move down. Now dodge the circles.

There is currently a bug where if you sing too low the harmonic frequencies appear louder than the base frequency and so the square will go up instead of down.

There is also an issue with some sound cards where there is a large latency from the microphone to the game. I have no idea how to fix this.
